DESaccess at NCSA 
=======================

Overview
------------------

[DESaccess](https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/desaccess/) is an open source set of tools to access and analyze astronomical data, used as a primary research tool by hundreds of astronomer around the globe. 

Developed at the [National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)](http://http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/), DESaccess provides a primary set of basic web applications and a programmatic API to access [Dark Energy Survey (DES)](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) release data. It provides an interface to submit asynchronous jobs that perform potentially lengthy operations involving the DES release catalogs stored on the co-located Oracle database. These jobs include executing SQL statements and generating cutouts from the image data given list of positions and desired areal dimensions. 

About this repo
---------------------

This code repository serves as a public snapshot of the core components of the DESaccess service deployed for the DR2 public data release, including a snapshot of the deployment of the [DR2 data release documentation website](https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases/dr2).

Documentation about this deployment system can be found in `/docs/index.rst` which defines the top of the Sphinx-based documentation tree.
